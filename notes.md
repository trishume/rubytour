# Part 1: Basic Classes
- one of the most useful things to learn
- you can see that the most common classes have hundreds of methods built in
- taking a random sample we can see some interesting things you probably won't find
  in most other languages.

# Symbol#to_proc
- Start with a taste of what you'll learn
- One of my favourite examples
- A powerful method that not everyone knows

# Loops

- Looping methods are a powerful category of Ruby methods
- One of the things that is most different between Ruby and other scripting languages

# Benefits

- Using these methods you can convey your intention
- By matching the construct to your use case you make things easier to read
- I use Ruby a lot for writing programming contests and this helps me avoid off-by-one bugs. While competitors are staring at piles of nested for loops I don't have to waste time checking that `5.times` runs the right number of times.
